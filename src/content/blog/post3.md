After winning Tech 901's CTF two years in a row, people ask me for tips. Here's what actually helped:

**Learn your tools cold.** When the clock is ticking, you don't want to be Googling Burp Suite basics. Get comfortable with your toolkit before competition day.

**Read writeups obsessively.** After every CTF, read how others solved the challenges - especially the ones you couldn't crack. That's where real learning happens.

**Don't tunnel vision.** Stuck for more than 20 minutes? Move on. Points are points, and sometimes the "hard" challenge is easier than the one you're banging your head against.

**Practice on platforms.** HackTheBox, TryHackMe, PicoCTF - there's no shortage of practice material. Consistency beats intensity.

Most importantly: have fun. It's a game. The skills transfer to real work, but the competition itself should be enjoyable.
